# FMRL Ink

fmrl.ink provides ephemeral, anonymous, and secure mailing lists, ideal for short-term collaborations, activist organizing, and temporary group communication. Subscribers remain completely anonymous, and all subscription data is permanently erased upon expiry, ensuring maximum privacy.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- **Create a Mailing List:**\
  Send an email with the subject line `3 days` (or any number of days) to:

  ```
  anykeyword@fmrl.ink
  ```

  This subscribes your email anonymously for the specified number of days.

- **Notify Others:**\
  CC additional recipients to notify them of the group's existence. They can subscribe similarly.

- **Anonymity Guaranteed:**\
  Any email sent to the generated address will anonymously forward to all current subscribers.

- **Automatic Expiration:**\
  After the subscription duration ends, you're automatically unsubscribed. When no subscribers remain, the list permanently disappears, leaving no trace.

## üì¨ Commands & Shortcuts

- **Subscribe:** Send an email with subject `X days`.
- **Unsubscribe:** Subject line: `unsubscribe` or click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of emails.
- **Extend Subscription:** Subject line: `extend X`.
- **Help:** Subject line: `help` to receive detailed instructions.

## üîê Privacy & Security Guarantees

- **Ephemeral Storage:** All subscriber data is deleted permanently once expired.
- **Anonymous Emails:** Sender identity and subscriber lists are never revealed.
- **Encryption:** Subscribers' emails are encrypted with Google Cloud KMS.
- **Court-proof Privacy:** Algorithmic privacy ensures no historical subscriber data can ever be recovered or accessed.
